# Sublime Packages User Folder

This is the User directory under my Sublime Text 3 Packages area.  I'm using a MacBook Air.  Some of these packages and options may not work on other systems.

## Key Files of Note

### What have I installed?

 - **Package Control.sublime-settings** - List of all packages I have installed

### What do I recall customizing after installation?

 - **Preferences.sublime-settings** - Top-level customizations.  The Twilight color scheme will not be available under the SublimeLinter folder until after it has been selected from the menus: "Preferences > Color Scheme > Color Scheme - Default > Twilight".
 - **CoffeeCompile.sublime-settings** - Added coffee_path to get BetterCoffee to work
 - **ColorHighlighter.sublime-settings** - Customized to fill in colors in CSS files
 - **Markdown.sublime-settings** - Customized to add line numbers
 - **Node.sublime-settings** - Added a couple lines so that I can run simple non-DOM JavaScript scripts in the Sublime console
